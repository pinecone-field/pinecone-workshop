# Creating Your First Index 🆕📊

Pinecone indexes are incredibly powerful tools that can handle billions of vectors while returning data at lightning-fast speeds ⚡ and allowing for quick and efficient data upserting. Let's dive in and create your first index! 🌟

1. Now that you're logged into Pinecone, look for the "Create Index" button right in the center of the screen. Click on it to start the magic! ✨

2. Give your index a memorable name like `pinecone-workshop`. This name will be your trusty companion throughout your Pinecone journey. 🏷️

3. Set the dimensions of your index to 1536. This value determines the size of the vectors your index will handle. 📏

4. Change the metric to "cosine".  📐

5. Finally, click on the "Create Index" button at the bottom to bring your index to life! 🎉

Watch in awe as your index is swiftly created, along with fascinating details about its configuration and creation speed. This is made possible by Pinecone's serverless option, which provides the best out-of-the-box experience, allowing you to scale to billions of vectors while still being cost-effective. 💸

## Extra Learning 🧠

### Cosine Similarity 📐

Cosine similarity is a widely used measure of similarity between two vectors in a multi-dimensional space. It calculates the cosine of the angle between the vectors, providing a value between -1 and 1. Cosine similarity is particularly useful in various applications, including machine learning, natural language processing, and information retrieval. It offers a measure of how alike two vectors are, focusing on their orientation rather than magnitude.

### Embedding Model Dimensions 📏

Each embedding model has different dimensions because they are trained to capture different aspects and complexities of the input data. The dimensions of an embedding model determine the size of the vectors it generates. Higher-dimensional embeddings can capture more intricate patterns and relationships in the data, but they also require more computational resources. The choice of dimensions depends on the specific task, the complexity of the data, and the available computational resources. Common dimensions for embedding models range from a few hundred to several thousand.
